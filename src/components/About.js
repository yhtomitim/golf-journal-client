          If you're anything like me when it comes to golf, you're terrible. You stop keeping score around hole 5 because you're already well on your way to a score in the low 100s. But, you also hit some great shots. Really good shots. Shots that make you keep coming back to the torture chamber that is a golf course. The thing is, the scorecard is only half of the story. If there was a way to both keep your score, and also take notes on each hole that could help you understand <strong>how</strong> you got that score and indentify trends for improvement.

          <strong>Golf Journal</strong> solves this problem for golfers who want a place to keep their score data and notes on how they achieved that score in one place. Golfers can enter the par score for a hole, their own score, and notes on their perfomance. Leaving notes on a performance on each hole can dramatically improve a golfer's game round-to-round.
